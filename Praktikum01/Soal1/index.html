                   Yet the plural of mouse or a nest full of mice, <br>

                    If the plural of man is always called men,<br>
                    Why shouldn't the plural of pan be called pen?<br>
                    If I speak of my foot and show you my feet,<br>
                    And I give you a boot, would a pair be called beet?<br>
                    If one is a tooth and a whole set are teeth,<br>
